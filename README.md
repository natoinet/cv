# Headless Infographic CV

A data-driven, infographic-style Curriculum Vitae built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
The design separates structure (HTML) from content (JSON), allowing for easy "theming" and company-specific snapshots.

## How it works
* **Engine:** `index.html` + `cv_script.js` renders the layout.
* **Data:** `cv.json` contains the profile data (Standard JSON Resume schema compliant).
* **Privacy:** Contact details are hidden automatically on the public web version.
